# Starship Theme Switcher

A simple setup to easily switch starship themes / profiles. (obv customizable, this repo is just a starting point)

You can use following command to switch predifined themes:
```bash
starship-theme blue
```

Maybe a lil bit inefficient, it just has a themes folder in `./config`, with all starship configs, 
and copies the selected theme to the starship config location.

Contributions are welcome, please rember to use conventional commits :)

# Usage

Put the `starship-theme` in your bin directory, make it executable, basically done.
You may have to adjust certain paths, in case you don't use the same as me...
